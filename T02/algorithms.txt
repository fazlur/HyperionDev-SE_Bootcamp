Problem:

	An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then
	stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the
	algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello,
	World”.
	
Pseudo code solution:

	request user to input their name
	store user input in a variable called "first_name"
	print out "first_name" “Hello,World”.
	
	
	
Problem:

	An algorithm that asks a user to enter their age and then stores
	their age in a variable called age. Subsequently, the algorithm
	should print out “You’re old enough” if the user’s age is over or
	equal to 18, or print out “Almost there” if the age is equal to or over
	16, but less than 18. Finally, the algorithm should print out “You’re
	just too young” if the user is younger than (and not equal to) 16.
	
Pseudo code solution:

	request user to input their age
	
	store user input in a variable called "age"
	
	if the value of "age" is equal or higer than 18
		print out “You’re old enough”
	else if the value of "age" is equal or higer than 16
		print out “Almost there”
	else
		print out “You’re just too young”
