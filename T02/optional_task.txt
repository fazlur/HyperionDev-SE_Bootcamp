Problem:

	Write the pseudocode for the algorithm that asks the user for a number and stores 
	that number in a variable called n. Then the algorithm should calculate and print 
	out the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
	
Pseudo code solution:

	request user to input a number
	store the number in a variable called "n"
	create a variable called "count" and assign the value 0 to it
	create a variable called "previousFibonacci" and assign the value 0 to it
	create a variable named "currentFibonacci" and assign it the value of 1
	while the value of "count" is lower than the value "n"
		if the value of "count" is 0
			print out the value of "previousFibonacci" and print out the value of "currentFibonacci"
			increase the value of "count" to 1
		if the value of "count" is higer than 0
			print out the value of  "currentFibonacci"
			copy the value of "currentFibonacci" to "previousFibonacci"
			set the value "currentFibonacci" to the sum of it's value with the value of "previousFibonacci"
