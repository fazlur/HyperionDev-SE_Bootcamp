# This example program is meant to demonstrate errors.
 
# There are some errors in this program, try run the program by pressing F5.
# Now look at the error messages and find and fix the errors.

# Fixed a SyntaxError on line  6, the print was missing the brackets
print ("Welcome to the error program")
# Fixed a SyntaxError and IndentationError onpre vious line 7 (code below), the print was missing the brackets and was indented
print ("\n")

# The next 6 lines (below) were indented where they didn't have to
ageStr == "24 years old" #I'm 24 years old.
age = int(ageStr)
print("I'm" + age + "years old.")
three = "3"

answerYears = age + three
#The next 2 prints where missing the brackets, which is a syntax error
print ("The total number of years:" + "answerYears")
answerMonths = answer * 12
print ("In 3 years and 6 months, I'll be " + answerMonths + " months old")

#HINT, 330 months is the correct answer
