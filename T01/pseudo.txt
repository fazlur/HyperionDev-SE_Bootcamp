Problem:

	An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly
	until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the
	largest of the numbers that were input.
	
Pseudo code solution:

	ask user to enter a positive number
		add the number to a list
		if the number is 0
			output the largest number in the list
			stop asking the user to input numbers
		else
			go back to the beginning 
			
			
			

Problem:

	An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then
	returns their arithmetic average.
	
Pseudo code solution:

	get list of integers
	add all the numbers and divide by the total number of entries in the list
	output average of numbers in the list 
	
	
	
	
Problem:

	An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products
	(in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.
	
Pseudo code solution:

	get grocery list
	sort the list in aphabetical order
	go through each item in the sorted list
		if the product in the list hasn't been bought yet
			output product
			
			


Problem:

	An algorithm from the flowchart in the task
	
Pseudo code solution:

	read value of X and Y
	sum X and Y and assign the result to S
	divide S by 2 and assign the result top A
	multiply X by Y and assign the result to P
	output the values of S, A, P
